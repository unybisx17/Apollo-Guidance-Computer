Welcome to the Apollo Guidance Computer Display and Keyboard Interface flight simulator. The simulator  will run on any version of Windows from Windows 95 right up until Windows 11. The executable file is 18MB in size and requires very little RAM (8MB). It was developed on the PowerBuilder V6.0 (1997) platform. The original source code file agc.pbl is included with this installation as well as two text files that show the source code for the ENTR and PRO keys.

It is implied that the user of this software is familiar with the Apollo Guidance Computer and display Keyboard operational principles and procedures. If you are unfaimiliar with how the AGC and DSKY works, it is not recommended that you use this software. 

USE THIS SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. COPY THE FONTS TO C:\WINDOWS\FONTS (UP UNTIL WIN 7) DON'T KNOW AFTER WIN 7 WHERE FONTS ARE STORED. IF FONTS AREN'T INSTALLED, THE PROGRAM WILL STILL WORK, BUT THE AGC WILL USE THE DEFAULT WINDOWS FONT WHICH WILL MAKE THE PROGRAM LOOK GOOFY.

2. THE FILES CAN BE COPIED TO YOUR COMPUTER ANYWHERE YOU LIKE. PBVM60.DLL AND AGC1.87.exe MUST BE IN THE SAME FOLDER. EX: c:\PROGRAM FILES\AGC

3. READ THE OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS AND PROCEDURES! Its possible to skip steps in the landing and ascent procedures but it is not recommended. It could bring out bugs including a possible infinite loop.

5. This software employs .wav files for landing, lunar liftoff and docking effects. The files are embedded and will launch your default media player upon execution.

6. Like the original ACG installed in the Apollo spacecraft, this software has bugs which can surface if the flight procedures aren't followed.
